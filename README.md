<h1>Rules</h1>

This module is a port to Backdrop of the Drupal contributed module 'Rules'. The Rules module allows site administrators to define conditionally executed actions based on occurring events (known as reactive or ECA rules).

The Drupal version of Rules makes extensive use of classes and functions provided by the Drupal contributed module Entity API. Because Backdrop includes an entity module in core, the required elements have been integrated within this port of Rules for Backdrop, placing them in the includes folder with file name prefix 'ext'.

Because of this significant difference it will not be possible to upgrade Rules directly from a Drupal 7 to a Backdrop installation, however it should be possible to export rules from Drupal and import them into Backdrop.


<h2>Status</h2>

This port to Backdrop is ready for installation and testing. 




<h2>Installation</h2>

Install this module using the official Backdrop CMS instructions at https://backdropcms.org/guide/modules
